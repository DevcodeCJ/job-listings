# Project: Job Listings

**Hello!** ðŸ‘‹

This is a Front-end challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) focused on building a job listings page with filtering capabilities.

## Building the project

The workflow for this project focused majorly on the tools below:

1. HTML

2. CSS Flexbox

3. React JS

Filtering is achieved based on the following categories and are dynamically accessed by iterating over the job properties provided in the JSON file:

- Role: Frontend, Backend, Fullstack
- Level: Junior, Midweight, Senior
- Languages: Python, Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Tools: React, Sass, Vue, Django, RoR (Ruby on Rails)

Big thanks to Front-end Mentor!

**Happy Coding!** ðŸ˜„
